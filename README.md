# Word-guesser
This is a quick "hangman but without the actual graphic" game,
made in arond 30-min.


### Installing
```
cargo install word-guesser
```

### Cargo package name
Since this is just a quick 30-min coding exercise,
if there's a legitimate reason (such as a ML crate) needing this crate name,
send me a message on [Github](https://github.com/mibmo).
